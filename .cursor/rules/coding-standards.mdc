Rule: "Follow the project's existing style guide and conventions."

Guidance: "Maintain consistent formatting, naming conventions, and architectural patterns throughout the codebase.
Make props ReadOnly.  
Prefer using nullish coalescing operator (`??`) instead of a logical or (`||`)"

Strive for using existing frameworks when possible vs inventing the wheel or making new components.
